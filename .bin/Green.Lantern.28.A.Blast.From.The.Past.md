The issue begins with Hal Jordan waking up in a hospital bed after being injured by Sinestro, his former mentor and now archenemy. He is greeted by Carol Ferris, his love interest and boss at Ferris Aircraft, who tells him that he has been in a coma for three weeks. She also informs him that he is under arrest for drunk driving and causing the death of an innocent man.
 
Hal is shocked and confused by these accusations, as he has no memory of the incident. He tries to explain that he was attacked by Sinestro, but Carol doesn't believe him. She thinks he is delusional and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She tells him that he needs to face the consequences of his actions and get help.
 
Meanwhile, in outer space, Sinestro is plotting his revenge against Hal and the Green Lantern Corps. He has stolen a power ring from one of the Guardians of the Universe, the ancient beings who created the Corps and oversee its operations. He plans to use the ring to create an army of yellow-clad warriors who will challenge the green-clad protectors of the galaxy.
 
Back on Earth, Hal is visited by two agents from the Central Bureau of Regulation (CBR), a government agency that regulates superhuman activity. They tell him that they have evidence that he is a Green Lantern, and that they want to take him into custody for questioning. They also reveal that they have confiscated his power ring and battery, which they found in his car after the accident.
 
Hal realizes that he has been set up by Sinestro, who must have tampered with his ring and caused him to lose control of his vehicle. He decides to escape from the hospital and retrieve his ring before it falls into the wrong hands. He uses his willpower to activate his ring remotely, and creates a green construct of a motorcycle to ride away.
 
He is pursued by the CBR agents, who have their own power rings and batteries, which they obtained from a secret source. They fire yellow energy blasts at Hal, who dodges them with his green energy shield. He wonders how they got their rings, and suspects that Sinestro might be behind it.
 
He reaches his car, where he finds his battery hidden under the seat. He recharges his ring and prepares to confront Sinestro. However, before he can do so, he is teleported away by another power ring. He finds himself in a strange alien world, where he is greeted by a familiar face: Abin Sur, the former Green Lantern of Sector 2814, who gave Hal his ring before dying.
 
Abin Sur tells Hal that he has brought him to this world to train him and prepare him for his destiny. He says that Hal is the chosen one, who will lead the Green Lantern Corps against Sinestro and his yellow army. He also reveals that he is not really dead, but has transcended his physical form and become one with the power ring.
 
He explains that the power ring is more than just a tool; it is a living entity that bonds with its wearer and records their memories and emotions. He says that he has been watching over Hal through the ring, and that he is proud of him for overcoming his fears and doubts. He says that Hal has great potential, but he needs to learn more about the history and secrets of the Green Lantern Corps.
 
He then takes Hal on a journey through time and space, showing him various events and places related to the Corps. He shows him Oa, the home planet of the Guardians; Mogo, the living planet who is also a Green Lantern; Ysmault, the prison planet where Sinestro was banished; Qward, the antimatter world where Sinestro forged his yellow ring; Korugar, Sinestro's home planet where he ruled as a tyrant; and Coast City, Hal's home town where he will face his greatest challenge.
 
Along the way, Abin Sur tells Hal about the origin and purpose of the Green
